# 100-days-of-python _Challenge_

### About the Challenge

This repository chronicles my journey of learning Python programming over  100 days with _Angela Yu_. Here, you'll find my daily coding
exercises, and _reflections_ on my progress.

### Goals

My primary goals of doing this challenge are to:

* Gain a solid understanding of Python fundamentals
* Develop proficiency in various Python programming techniques
* Build practical Python projects to apply learned concepts
* Enhance problem-solving and computational thinking skills
* Cultivate a consistent learning habit and discipline

### Learnings
_I started from day 15 because, before that, it was a beginner phase in which I already knew_

**Day 17:** What is [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) and how to use it.
