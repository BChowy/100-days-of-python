# 100-days-of-python _Challenge_

### About the Challenge

This repository chronicles my journey of learning Python programming over  100 days with _Angela Yu_. Here, you'll find
my daily coding
exercises, and _reflections_ on my progress.

### Goals

My primary goals of doing this challenge are to:

* Gain a solid understanding of Python fundamentals
* Develop proficiency in various Python programming techniques
* Build practical Python projects to apply learned concepts
* Enhance problem-solving and computational thinking skills
* Cultivate a consistent learning habit and discipline

### Learnings
_I started from day 15 because before that it was a beginner phase which I already know_

**Day 17:** What is [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) and how to use it.

**Day 18:** How to read modules documentation. And what are: _Turtle_ and _Colorgram_ modules.

**Day 19:** How to use event listeners in Turtle Module.

**Day 20:** Learned about the _time_ module and how to use _sleep()_ method. Learned more about the _Screen_ class, and
how to use _update()_ method.

**Day 21:** What is inheritance, and how to inherit another class.

**Day 25:** What is "absolute" and "relative" paths. And how to open files for read/write using ```with open (file.txt) as file```.


### Reflection

- Days 20 & 21 were by far the most enjoyable. Learning how to create a _snake game_ is AWESOME. I couldn't imagine it
was possible to create it using the _turtle_ module before this. Going through the development of each little feature
of the game while making each class work with another was fascinating.


- On day 23, another day, I got to use modules and inheritance. It was fun to make the PONG game as much as the snake
game. And I got to learn and understand how each part of the game works!
